<h1 align="center">Installation</h1>

<h4 align="center">JAMES 1.1</h4>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Download distibution. You will find the last update in the java.apache.org download page.
  Extract all files in your favorite folder.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Startup</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT/2k users should just run /bin/run.bat. Unix users will find run.sh
    in the same folder (use chmod to make it executable). A JVM must be in the path.
    The Loader will extract the configuration template from the jar (James.jar)
    and place it under /conf/. Then will prompt you to fill the template with
    needed values.
<br>
    Edit /conf/JAMES.conf.xml and fill it with needed configuration following
    instructions inside. The configuration file is filled with defaults. Values
    which cannot be set as default needs to be filled. Basically to make it work
    just replace any FILL ME tag with the appropriate value.
    The current distribution requires you to set only two values: the address of  (at least) one DNS server in the dnsserver configuration; and a password for access via RemoteManager, in the remotemanager section.
<br> All other .conf files belongs to others Blocks that
    cooperate with JAMES to make it work. They do not need specific configurations
    since they are filled with defaults but a fast look may help.</p>

    <p>Running [run* -help] will provide a simple command line help.
    By default Avalon will use Xerces.jar as XML parser, place the log file
    in /logs/ and uses as configuration file /conf/avalon.conf.xml.
    You can override these defaults using run [options].</p>
    <p>Most UNIX systems require superuser privileges to open sockets below
    1024, which includes the IANA-standard SMTP (on port 25) and POP3
    (on port 110). These default ports can be changed in the conf.xml file.
    (Obviously, you would then need to reconfigure your clients. This may not
     be an option if you want to receive mail from external mailservers.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Kickstart</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>Once started you'll see a message saying Avalon is running. This means Avalon
    has loaded JAMES and every other needed Block (see /logs/avalon.log) and is
    now waiting for a socket request.

    At first run James will not have any local users set so it will only relay mail to remote servers.
    To register a local user open a telnet session with localhost (assumming you have not changed the default servernames in the conf.xml file) on port 4555, log in
    as root ("root[enter] <password-you-set-in-conf.xml>[enter]") and type "help" for a list of availale
    command in the "JAMES remote administrator tool". It is really a basic set but
    should allow you to test installation. An improved managing tool will be available as
    soon as someone can help writing it :).

    Once you have some local users registered try sending mail to one of them @localhost
    with SMTP (port 25). You'll see the mail appear under ../var//mail/localinbox/[user] (or whatever you have specified for the inbox repository).
    Try now to retrive that mail using POP3 (port 110).
    Trace out JAMES actions in /logs/*info.log.
    Action that will be taken by JAMES on incoming mail are configured in the mailet
    pipe line (/conf/james.conf.xml). Look there if you want to understand what's happening.</p>

<p>  Good luck :)
