Interestingly, while researching what other applications do I have found scant support for a fully fledeged LDAP retry mechanism. This isn't to say that such a thing is bad, but it does demonstrate that most organisations get by without it.
In robust deployment architectures, should an LDAP server instance fail there will be others to take up the slack. This is probably why the Tomcat JNDIRealm, which uses LDAP in a similar way to James, retries just once. It will get a connection to an alternative and be happily on its way. Pragmatically, should this second attempt fail most likey many other services have also failed. Operationally, the only way forward is to identify the critical service that has failed, fix and restart it and then restart all of the services that depend on it.
This does not detract from the need for a retry mechanism for LDAP via JNDI...
