Simple tests:
1 Send FETCH response when another session performs a STORE against a message
    (concurrent/FetchResponse.test)
2 Send EXISTS and RECENT responses when a message is added
    (concurrent/ExistsResponse.test) - still need RECENT
3 Expunge response when another session performs a EXPUNGE against the mailbox



From RFC2180
3. Deletion/Renaming of a multi-accessed mailbox
### Need to pick one of these 3...
3.1. The server MAY fail the DELETE/RENAME command of a multi-accessed
     mailbox

3.3. The server MAY allow the DELETE/RENAME of a multi-accessed
     mailbox, but disconnect all other clients who have the mailbox
     accessed by sending a untagged BYE response.

3.4. The server MAY allow the RENAME of a multi-accessed mailbox by
     simply changing the name attribute on the mailbox.

4.1. Fetching of expunged messages

4.1.2 The server MAY allow the EXPUNGE of a multi-accessed mailbox,
      and on subsequent FETCH commands return FETCH responses only for
      non-expunged messages and a tagged NO.

             C2: B001 FETCH 3:5 ENVELOPE
             S2: * 3 FETCH ENVELOPE . . . (ENVELOPE info returned)
             S2: B001 NO Some of the requested messages no longer exist
### Return what you can, and send a "no": i like this.

4.2. Storing of expunged messages

4.2.1 If the ".SILENT" suffix is used, and the STORE completed
      successfully for all the non-expunged messages, the server SHOULD
      return a tagged OK.

4.2.2. If the ".SILENT" suffix is not used, and only expunged messages
       are referenced, the server SHOULD return only a tagged NO.

4.2.3. If the ".SILENT" suffix is not used, and a mixture of expunged
       and non-expunged messages are referenced, the server MAY set the
       flags and return a FETCH response for the non-expunged messages
       along with a tagged NO.
### Update what you can, and return "NO"

4.2.4. If the ".SILENT" suffix is not used, and a mixture of expunged
       and non-expunged messages are referenced, the server MAY return
       an untagged NO and not set any flags.
### Don't update anything, and return "NO"
