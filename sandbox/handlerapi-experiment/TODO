- Enable From/Sender and Date checks on message received
- Find a way to handle the old JunkHandlerScore stuff
- Check DataCmdHandler for correct clean-up on every exceptions
- Move abuse/postmaster tests from ResolvableEhloHeloHandlerTest to a generic SMTPServer compliance test
- on Rcpt message reject, the original code was logging a lot of informations. Maybe we should change the Hook callers to do something similar (in RcptCmdHandler create a log string including context() call)
- Check AuthRequiredToRelayRcptHook to see if it is correct to return different SMTP codes if Auth is announced (for relaying denied)
- Remove CURRENT_RECIPIENT key from state usage: I think we don't use it anymore but in tests.
- Check why testDNSRBLRehectWorks was expecting 550, while we return now 554 (or maybe we should return 530, but not 550).
- RcptOptions: introduce a new extension points to have Handlers to declare support for given command options so that the syntax check can support them.
  - maybe also add to Mail and Rcpt standard hooks an options map parameter (MAIL's SIZE, RCPT's ORCPT/NOTIFY keyworks)
  - or maybe another non public api hook to be implemented by smtp extensions.
- The AuthHook define a way to hook plain text user-pass tuple: this mean this won't work as soon as we'll try to implement another SASL mechanism: this is a common issue with POP3 APOP and IMAP SALS auth.
