- Enable From/Sender and Date checks on message received
- Find a way to handle the old JunkHandlerScore stuff
- Check DataCmdHandler for correct clean-up on every exceptions
- on Rcpt message reject, the original code was logging a lot of informations. Maybe we should change the Hook callers to do something similar (in RcptCmdHandler create a log string including context() call)
- RcptOptions: introduce a new extension points to have Handlers to declare support for given command options so that the syntax check can support them.
  - maybe also add to Mail and Rcpt standard hooks an options map parameter (MAIL's SIZE, RCPT's ORCPT/NOTIFY keyworks)
  - or maybe another non public api hook to be implemented by smtp extensions.
- The AuthHook define a way to hook plain text user-pass tuple: this mean this won't work as soon as we'll try to implement another SASL mechanism: this is a common issue with POP3 APOP and IMAP SALS auth.
- Decide what to do with services and DI (logging and more).
- SenderAuthIdentifyVerificationRcptHook use session.getConfigurationData().isVerifyIdentity() to decide wether to enable itself or not: isn't it better to add the handler to the config and commenting/uncommenting the handler already do the trick? If so we shoudl simply remove that configuration and remove the check in the code.
- DataCmdHandler.mailPostProcessor could be moved to a MessageHandler added by default as the first core handler.
