- Enable From/Sender and Date checks on message received
- Find a way to handle the old JunkHandlerScore stuff
- Check DataCmdHandler for correct clean-up on every exceptions
- Move abuse/postmaster tests from ResolvableEhloHeloHandlerTest to a generic SMTPServer compliance test
- on Rcpt message reject, the original code was logging a lot of informations. Maybe we should change the Hook callers to do something similar (in RcptCmdHandler create a log string including context() call)
- Check AuthRequiredToRelayRcptHook to see if it is correct to return different SMTP codes if Auth is announced (for relaying denied)
- Remove CURRENT_RECIPIENT key from state usage: I think we don't use it anymore but in tests.
- Check why testDNSRBLRehectWorks was expecting 550, while we return now 554 (or maybe we should return 530, but not 550).
