This document describes how to build Spring bean container support for Apache James

1. Preparations

1.1 Getting all libraries

Copy into the lib/ folder the following files:

from {James_Server}/lib: all files
from {James_Server}/bin/lib: all files
from {James_Server}/build/lib: james-2.3.0.jar mailet-2.3.jar mailet-api-2.3.jar
from {James_Server}/phoenix-bin/lib: all files
from {James_Server}/phoenix-bin/tools/lib: spice-configkit-1.1.2.jar
from the Spring Framework 2.0 distribution: spring.jar and commons-loggin.jar

1.2 Using your own James configuration

The configuration resides in src/main/config

In case you dare to replace this default configuration with your own, please make sure to make one
crucial change: at the top of james-config.xml replace the first part of the Entity references URLs
which is "../conf/" with "./" so they look like this:

<!ENTITY listserverConfig SYSTEM "./james-listmanager.xml">
<!ENTITY listserverStores SYSTEM "./james-liststores.xml">
<!ENTITY fetchmailConfig SYSTEM "./james-fetchmail.xml">
<!ENTITY smtphandlerchainConfig SYSTEM "./james-smtphandlerchain.xml">

No further change is needed.

2. Compile

Currently there is no build file.

Build all java files residing in src/main/java

3. Run

You need the resulting class files and all libraries in lib to run

org.apache.james.container.spring.Main

James should start like usually. Log messages go to the system console.
