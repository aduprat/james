      <p>This block controls general connection management.  There are two elements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>idle-timeout</strong> - the number of milliseconds that it will take for idle 
            client connections managed by this connection manager to be marked at timed out.  If no 
            value is specified, the value defaults to 5 minutes, 300000 milliseconds.  A value of 0 
            means that client sockets will not timeout.</li>
        <li><strong>max-connections</strong> - The max-connections parameter specifies the default 
            maximum number of client connections that this connection manager will allow per managed 
            server socket.  This value can be overridden by each individual service.  If no value is 
            specified, the value defaults to 30.  A value of 0 means that there is no limit imposed 
            by the connection manager, although resource limitations imposed by other components 
            (i.e. max # of threads) may serve to limit the number of open connections.</li>
      </ul>
