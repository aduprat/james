  <title>James 3.0 - Global Server Configuration</title>
 </properties>

<body>

  <section name="Global Server Configuration">
  
    <p>There are a number of global configuration blocks that do not fall into any one 
      component.  They have effects that are global in scope across the server.  Some of 
      these blocks are crucial, while others can be ignored by any but the most sophisticated 
      server administrators.</p>
    
    <subsection name="mailserver.xml">

      <p>This configuration block is defined by the <strong>mailserver</strong> tag.  All administrators 
      need to adjust this configuration block upon installation.  It no attributes, but several 
      children, all of which are required.
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>postmaster</strong> - the body of this element is the address that the server 
        will consider its postmaster address.  This address will be listed as the sender address 
        of all error messages that originate from James.  Also, all messages addressed to 
        postmaster@&lt;servername&gt;, where &lt;servername&gt; is one of the domain names whose 
        mail is being handled by James, will be redirected to this email address.</li>
        <li><strong>usernames</strong> - this element has no body, but instead has three required 
        boolean attributes.  These are <strong>ignoreCase</strong>, <strong>enabledAliases</strong>, 
        and <strong>enableForwarding</strong>.  The first of these determines whether email user names
        will be treated as case-insensitive or not.  The second attribute configures whether local user
        aliasing will be enabled.  Finally, the value of the third attribute determines whether forwarding 
        to potentially remote users will be enabled.</li>
        <li><strong>servernames</strong> - this element determines exactly which mail domains and IP 
        addresses the server will treat as local.  It has two boolean attributes - 
        <strong>autodetect</strong> and <strong>autodetectIP</strong>.  The first attribute, if true,
        causes the server to attempt to determine its own host name and add that to the list of local
        mail domains.  The second attribute causes the server to attempt to determine its own IP 
        address and add it to the list of local mail domains.  In addition to these attributes, this 
        tag has zero or more <strong>servername</strong> children.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>servername</strong> - a single host name or IP address that should be added to the list of 
          mail domains that the server considers local.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>inboxRepository</strong> - This is a simple container tag which contains a single child element.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>repository</strong> - this defines the mail repository that will be used to store 
          mail delivered locally.  This element has no body.  The required attribute <strong>type</strong> 
          is always set to "MAIL".  The required attribute <strong>repositoryURL</strong> addresses the
          repository as described in <a href="concept_repositories.html">the repository configuration section</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <p>This block controls the socket types available inside James.  Unless you are intending to enable SSL, it
