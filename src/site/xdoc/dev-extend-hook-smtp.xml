  <section name="Introduction to SMTP Hooks">
  
    <p>The James SMTP Server Component allows to easy write your own code which will get executed 
       in the SMTP-Transaction. Thats a bit different then using a Mailet a.k.a Mailet-API.</p>
      
    <p>As your code will get executed before the mail was even accepted. This can help you in many ways,
       most times its used for rejecting SPAM/Junk within the SMTP-Dialog. But it can be used for 
       other things too.</p>
      
    <p>Its up to you and your use case.</p>

    <p>But be aware as your code needs to get executed during the SMTP-Transaction it should not 
       take to long to execute. As it will need to fit in before the timeout was hit which can be 
       different on every mailserver. But as a general rule as long as your code can get executed 
       within 30 seconds it should be fine.</p>
      
  </section>

  <section name="Supported Hooks in James Server">
  
    <p>The James SMTP Server comes with a few interfaces which helps you to "hook-in" a 
       specific SMTP Command. That means your class which implements the given interface(s) will get
       called after the SMTP-Command was parsed and depending on your implementation it will handle it.</p>

    <p>In detail the following hooks are supported:</p>

    <subsection name="AuthHook">
      <p>Allows to hook in your code for authenticate users for sending mail via SMTP AUTH. 
      You could for example query your own database table to see if a user should be allowed to 
      send mail with the given username and password.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="ConnectionHandler">
      <p>Allows to hook in your code on a new connection. So you could just drop it 
      or do something else.</p>
    </subsection>
 
    <subsection name="HeloHook">
      <p>Allows to hook in your code in the HELO and EHLO commands.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="MailHook">
      <p>Allows to hook in your code in the MAIL command. Like checking the sender 
      which was given with MAIL FROM: &lt;whatever@example&gt;</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="MailParametersHook">
      <p>Allows to hook in given parameters in the EHLO command.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="JamesMessageHook">

      <p>Allow to hook in your code after the email was received via the DATA command and 
      was marked for queuing by the CLRF.CRLF sequence. This will get executed right before 
      the message will actual get queued.</p>
      
      <p>IMPORTANT: If you want to do heavy processing here 
      and not want to reject the method based on a criteria you are most times better of to 
      use the Mailet API!</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection name="QuitHook">
      <p>Allow to hook in your code in the QUIT command.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="RcptHook">
      <p>Allows to hook in your code in the RCPT command. Like implementing a custom logic to 
      check if the mail for a given recipient should get accepted or rejected.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="UnknownCmdHook">
      <p>Allows to hook in your code on every unknown command.</p>
    </subsection>

  </section>

  <section name="Return-Codes">

    <p>Each of the above mention Hooks need to return a HookResult to tell the SMTPServer 
    if the next registered Hook should get called or not.</p>
    
    <p>For this the HookReturnCode is used.</p>

  </section>
 
  <section name="Custom Hooks Implementations">

    <subsection name="Why a Custom Hook">

      <p>What to do if the Hook API is not enough for you ? You want for example 
         to write a code which handles a new command like "YOURCOOLCOMMAND: whatever@example".</p>
    
      <p>For this kind of needs you should implement the CommandHandler interface. 
         This gives you a lower-level API to handle this kind of tasks. If you want 
         to support a custom Hook in your CommandHandler its the best
         to just extend AbstractHookableCmdHandler.</p>
         
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Things to Remember ">

      <p>Be aware that your implementation needs to be thread-safe as it will get used as singleton. 
         If you need to store temporary informations within the SMTP Transaction/Session you should
         use the SMTPSession.getState().put(...) and SMTPSession.getConnectionState().put(...) methods.</p>
 
      <p>For a more explanation see the <a href="http://james.apache.org/protocols/apidocs/index.html">apidocs</a> for the protocols library which
         is used by James SMTP Server.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Get your Hook implementations loaded">
  
      <p>Just create a jar file which contains your code and put it in /path/to/james/conf/lib/ 
      folder. The jar will get picked up by the ClassLoader automatic then.</p>
    
      <p>After that open the smtpserver.xml file and add your hook to the <code>&lt;handlers&gt;&lt;/handlers&gt;</code> block in the order you 
       want to have it executed. So if you have 2 MailHook implementation make sure the first one 
       which is listed in smtpserver.xml is the one you want to call first.</p>
