  <section name="Priority in the Spooling Queues">
  
    <p>Priority is supported when James (de)queues the mails during the spooling process.</p>
    
    <p>For this just add a Mail header with name "MAIL_PRIORITY" to the mail you send.</p>

    <p>This mail header should use one of the following value:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>0 for LOW_PRIORITY</li>
      <li>5 for NORMAL_PRIORITY (default)</li> 
      <li>9 for HIGH_PRIORITY</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Default priority if no MAIL_PRIORITY attribute set is NORMAL_PRIORITY.</p>
