<section name="James 3.0-M1 (Milestone 1)">
<p>
James 3.0-M1 represents the leading edge of development. This codestream has many more
features than the 2.x code, but is not as well tested in production. The internal APIs
are under current validation and are expected to be subject to change. Reasonable
configuration compatibility has been retained with 3.0.
</p>
<p>
The Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server (a.k.a. Apache James) is a 100% pure Java SMTP, IMAP4 and POP3 Mail 
server designed to be a complete and portable enterprise mail engine solution.  
James is based on currently available open protocols.
</p>
<p>
The James server also serves as a mail application platform.  The James project hosts the Apache Mailet API, 
and the James server is a Mailet container.  This feature makes it easy to design, write, and deploy 
custom applications for mail processing.  This modularity and ease of customization is one of James' 
strengths, and can allow administrators to produce powerful applications surprisingly easily.
</p>
<p>
James is now built on top of Spring 3.0 in replacement of trunk version of the <a href="http://avalon.apache.org/">Avalon Application Framework</a>.
With Spring, We keep the  good development practices introduced by Avalon such as 
Component Oriented Programming and  Inversion of Control. 
The stable and robust Spring container provides a strong foundation for the James server.
</p>
<p>
James 3.0-M1 requires Java 1.5 but Java 1.6 is recommended.
</p>
<p>
A migration guide for users willing to upgrade from 3.0 to 3.0-M1 is under redaction.
</p>
<p>
The NNTP News server present in James 3.0 has been removed from the 3.0 release line.
</p>
<p>
This documentation is intended to be an introduction to the concepts behind the James implementation, as well 
as a guide to installing, configuring, (and for developers) building the James server.

<section name="Release Announcement">

<p>The Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server (a.k.a. Apache James) Project is happy to announce the release 
of version 3.0 of the Apache James server.</p>

<p>James is a 100% pure Java Mail and News server designed to be a complete and portable enterprise 
mail engine solution.  James supports currently available IETF protocols, including SMTP,POP3 and NNTP 
, and it and IMAP are targeted for full functionality in v3).  James 
is able to store user and message data either in a file-system or a JDBC-compatible database, 
allowing fast, reliable, even real-time replicated storage.</p>

<p>James provides a powerful, flexible mail application engine through support for the Apache Mailet 
API.  With its Mailet pipeline architecture, James can be used not only to provide standard e-mail 
services, but also to implement custom e-mail applications.</p>

<p>The James mail server is deployed in production environments and has proven itself to be a robust 
and high performance mail solution.  Tests indicate that version 3.0 is able to maintain a constant 
mail throughput rate of thousands of messages/minute for continuous periods.</p>

<p>The James Community is also happy to announce the beginning of the design phase for James version 
3.0.  Features tentatively slated for that version include enhancements to nearly every area of 
functionality, including full IMAP support, improved mailing list capabilities, fastfail support, 
smtp-api for developing own fastfail filters and the next revision of the Mailet API.  This is expected
to be an exciting time in James development.  We are actively 
looking for eager, capable developers to contribute to James.  If you're interesting in contributing 
to the James project, please subscribe to the James developer mailing list.</p>

<p>Information about James can be found at the <a href="http://james.apache.org/">James web site</a> 
at http://james.apache.org/.  Users interested in subscribing to the James 
<a href="mailto:server-user-subscribe@james.apache.org">user</a> and 
<a href="mailto:server-dev-subscribe@james.apache.org">developer</a> mailings lists should send emails
