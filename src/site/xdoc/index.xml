<section name="James 3.0-M1 (Milestone 1)">
<p>
James 3.0-M1 represents the leading edge of development. This codestream has many more
features than the 2.x code, but is not as well tested in production. The internal APIs
are under current validation and are expected to be subject to change. Reasonable
configuration compatibility has been retained with 2.3.
</p>
<p>
The Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server (a.k.a. Apache James) is a 100% pure Java SMTP, IMAP4 and POP3 Mail 
server designed to be a complete and portable enterprise mail engine solution.  
James is based on currently available open protocols.
</p>
<p>
The James server also serves as a mail application platform.  The James project hosts the Apache Mailet API, 
and the James server is a Mailet container.  This feature makes it easy to design, write, and deploy 
custom applications for mail processing.  This modularity and ease of customization is one of James' 
strengths, and can allow administrators to produce powerful applications surprisingly easily.
</p>
<p>
James is now built on top of Spring 3.0 in replacement of trunk version of the <a href="http://avalon.apache.org/">Avalon Application Framework</a>.
With Spring, We keep the  good development practices introduced by Avalon such as 
Component Oriented Programming and  Inversion of Control. 
The stable and robust Spring container provides a strong foundation for the James server.
</p>
<p>
James 3.0-M1 requires Java 1.5 but Java 1.6 is recommended.
</p>
<p>
A migration guide for users willing to upgrade from 2.3 to 3.0-M1 is under redaction.
</p>
<p>
The NNTP News server present in James 2.3 has been removed from the 3.0 release line.
</p>
<p>
This documentation is intended to be an introduction to the concepts behind the James implementation, as well 
as a guide to installing, configuring, (and for developers) building the James server.
