  <title>James 3.0 - Installation</title>
 </properties>

<body>

<section name="Requirements for James Server">

<subsection name="Java Virtual Machine">

  <p>James requires a Java Runtime Environment of Java version 1.5 or higher installed to run the 
     James application.  The exact JREs available depend on the platform.  A JRE must be downloaded and
     installed before James can run.  In addition, the environment variable JAVA_HOME should be set to
     the JRE home directory before running James.</p>
  
  <p>James 3.0 has been successfully tested on OpenJDK, Sun JDK and IBM JDK</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="System Requirements">
  
  <p>On Unix platforms, root access will be required to run James.  On these platforms, access to ports 
     below 1024 is generally restricted to the root user.  As SMTP, POP3, and IMAP all need to open 
     server sockets on such ports in standard configurations, James requires root access.</p>
  
  <p>Obviously James also requires sufficient disk space, processor power, and network bandwidth.  But, 
     other than what's been discussed here, it has no additional special requirements.</p>
  
  <p>James needs by default 512 MB RAM, but may need more depending on the load.</p>

  <p>On Linux, to run the startup/shutdown script via the 'james' command, you also need <code>libc6</code> 
     (on Ubuntu for example: <code>sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 libc6-dev-i386</code>).</p>

<section name="Details">

<subsection name="Step 1: Get It"> 

  <p>Obtain the full James binary distribution from the <a href="http://james.apache.org/download.cgi">James 
    release mirrors</a>.  Unpack the archive into your James installation directory.  Go to the bin subdirectory of the 
    installation directory and run "./james start".</p>

  <p>If you have downloaded a binary distribution, you do not need to build James. 
    Proceed directory to Step 1.</p>
  
  <p>If you have download a source package, process to the <a href="dev_build.html">build</a>.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Step 2: Deploy It">

  <p>Extract or copy all the files in the archive or dist 
    directory into your installation directory. </p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Step 3: Configure It">

  <p>After installing the binary, the next step is to adjust the initial configuration.  The server should be stopped, and then 
  configuration can proceed.  The most essential configuration is set in the config.xml file.  This file can be 
  found in the apps/james/SAR-INF subdirectory of the installation directory.</p>
  
  <p>The out of the box configuration makes certain assumptions and has some default values that are unlikely to 
  be appropriate for real-world servers.  There are a few issues that should be addressed immediately upon installation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>RemoteManager Administrator Account - Before the RemoteManager service can be used to add users to this server 
      installation an administrator account must be created.  More information can be found <a href="config_remotemanager.html">here</a>.</li>
      <li>DNS Servers - James needs to have access to a DNS server for domain resolution.  The out of the box 
      configuration assumes that there is a DNS server on localhost.  In general administrators will have to change 
      the configuration to point to a valid DNS server.  This can be done by adjusting the dnsserver configuration 
      block in the config.xml.  More information can be found <a href="config_serverwide.html">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Managed Domain Names/IP Addresses - Out of the box, James only handles mail that is sent to recipients at 
      localhost.  It will attempt to deliver all other email to remote SMTP servers.  To allow James to handle email 
      for your domain or IP address, you simply need to add the appropriate domain name or IP address to the servernames 
      section of the config.xml.  More information can be found <a href="config_serverwide.html">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Postmaster Address - More information can be found <a href="config_serverwide.html">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  
  <p>In addition to adjusting these parameters, you may wish to consult the documentation for a discussion of
     common configurations.  A list of such configurations, as well as the steps necessary to configure them, can
     be found <a href="index.html">here</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Read the short and snappy documentation at docs/index.html for a proper
      overview of configuring the system.</p>

  <p>M$ users should just run /bin/run.bat. Unix users will find run.sh under the 
    same directory. A JVM must be present and its location specified in the JAVA_HOME 
    environment variable. Set this on windows at the command prompt with something 
    similar to &quot;set JAVA_HOME=\jdk1.3\bin&quot; on *nix with JAVA_HOME=/jdk1.3/</p>
    
  <p>Running [run* --help] will provide a simple command line help. </p>
  
  <p>Most UNIX systems require superuser privileges to open sockets below 1024,
      which includes the IANA-standard SMTP (on port 25) and POP3 (on port 110).
      These default ports can be changed in the conf.xml file. (Obviously, you
      would then need to reconfigure your clients. This may not be an option if
      you want to receive mail from external mailservers.)</p>
    
  <p>The Avalon framework will unpack the necessary configuration files you will 
    need to start the server.  Wait until it is running, stop it again (ctrl-c), and 
    edit the configuration (thereafter *nix users can run the server in the background 
    using ./run.sh &amp;). For basic use, you only need to set two items in the 
    JAMES.conf.xml file: a root password for the remote administration facility 
    and the IP address of a DNS server. Once you have edited the configuration files, 
    press 'Enter' on the terminal where Avalon is waiting. </p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Step 4: Start It Up">

  <p>Once you have edited the configuration file you will need to restart James so that the changes take 
    effect.  When James starts, a list of the James services and the ports on which they are listening should 
    be displayed on the console.  Additional information about the system configuration is printed in the James log files 
    upon startup.</p>
  
  <p>Finally, after configuration is complete, it will be necessary to create user accounts before the James server 
    will be fully operational.  Instructions on creating user accounts can be found 
    <a href="adding_users.html">here</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Once started you'll see a message saying Avalon is running. This means that
      Avalon has loaded JAMES and every other needed Block (see /logs/avalon.log)
      and is now waiting for a socket request.
      Since at the beginning James is empty, it will not have any local users
      registered.
      To register a local user open a telnet session with localhost on port 4555,
      log in as root ("root[enter]  &lt;password-you-set-in-conf.xml&gt;[enter]") and
      type "help" for a list of available commands in the "JAMES remote
      administrator tool". It is really a basic set but should allow you to test
      installation.</p>
      
  <p>Once you have some local users registered, try sending mail to one of them
      @localhost with SMTP (port 25) (assuming you have not changed the default
      server names in the conf.xml file). You'll see the mail appear under
      ../var/mail/localinbox/[user].
      Try now to retrieve that mail using POP3 (port 110).
      Trace out JAMES actions in /logs/*info.log.
      Actions that will be taken by JAMES on incoming mail are configured in
      the mailet pipe line (/conf/JAMES.conf.xml). Look at it if you want to
      understand what's happening.</p>
