  <title>James 3.0 - Installation</title>
 </properties>

<body>

<section name="Requirements">

<p>James requires a Java Runtime Environment of Java version 1.4 or higher installed to run the 
James application.  The exact JREs available depend on the platform.  A JRE must be downloaded and
installed before James can run.  In addition, the environment variable JAVA_HOME must be set to
the JRE home directory before running James.</p>

<p>Runs on OpenJDK and Sun JDK</p>

<p>On Unix platforms, root access will be required to run James.  On these platforms, access to ports 
below 1024 is generally restricted to the root user.  As SMTP, POP3, and NNTP all need to open 
server sockets on such ports in standard configurations, James requires root access.</p>

<p>Obviously James also requires sufficient disk space, processor power, and network bandwidth.  But, 
other than what's been discussed here, it has no additional special requirements.</p>
</section>

<section name="Installation Comments">
<p>James installation involves a number of steps, each of which is described in some detail in the 
following sections.  But as this sequence of steps has confused some users in the past, additional 
comments seem warranted.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that the James configuration files are not unpacked from the James 
distribution until the first time James is started.  This is a consequence of the design of the 
Avalon Phoenix container used to run James.  Once James has been started, the distribution will 
be unpacked.  The server should be stopped, the configuration files edited, and the server restarted.</p>
<p>So the installation sequence is: <b>1) Start, 2) Stop, 3) Edit, 4) Restart</b>.</p>
</section>
<section name="Installing the Binary">
<subsection name="Installing a Stand-alone James Server">
<p>Obtain the full James binary distribution from the <a href="http://james.apache.org/download.cgi">James 
release mirrors</a>.  Unpack the archive into your James installation directory.  Go to the bin subdirectory of the 
installation directory and run the "run" script (either run.sh or run.bat, depending on your platform).  The configuration
file is now unpacked and available for editing.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name="Deploying a James Server in a Pre-Existing Phoenix Container">
<p><strong>Warning!</strong> - James requires Phoenix version 4.0.x to run.  There is a known issue with logging in Phoenix 4.0, so version 
4.0.1 or higher is strongly recommended.  Before attempting to deploy James in a Phoenix container, please make sure
it meets these version criteria.</p>
<p>Deploying James in Phoenix is fairly easy.  Obtain the james.sar file from the <a href="http://james.apache.org/download.cgi">James 
release mirrors</a>.  It can be found in the "Other Binaries" 
area of the distribution directory.  After downloading the james.sar,
simply place it in the apps subdirectory of your Phoenix installation.  Restart Phoenix, and the james.sar should unpack and you
will be ready to configure your James installation.</p>
</subsection>
</section>

<section name="Step 0: Building. (only necessary for daily snapshots)"> 
<p> If you have downloaded a binary distribution, you do not need to build James. 
  Proceed directory to Step 1. </p>
<p> To compile James from the source code you need <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>. 
  This is a Java-tailored, XML-configured, extensible build or make system. We 
  are currently using Ant 1.4, which is included in the source distribution.</p>
<p> If you have downloaded a daily snapshot, you need to build a distribution. 
  James includes Ant to compile and package its distribution. Extract the snapshot 
  to your favorite directory, cd to that directory and run the build by calling &quot;build&quot; 
  or &quot;./build.sh&quot; which will create an unpacked binary distribution 
  in the dist directory, but no archives.</p>
<p>This "./dist" directory is the distribution directory used in Step 1 and beyond. 
  You may either cd to ./dist, or you may copy and rename the dist directory to your 
  installation directory.</p>
<p>If you prefer you can run build with the &quot;dist&quot; task "build dist" 
  (or &quot;./build.sh dist&quot;). This will create the distribution in the "./dist" 
  directory as well as create .tgz and .zip copies of this directory, however it may 
  require other resources to build the documentation. </p>
<p> <strong>Warning!</strong> Any changes you've made in the 'dist' directory 
  will be lost after a recompilation. If you are making changes to the conf.xml 
  or other files, we recommend you backup and then change the copies in src to 
  avoid losing work. </p>
</section> <section name="Step 1: Installation."> 
<p> Download distibution. Extract or copy all the files in the archive or dist 
  directory intto your installation directory. </p>
</section>

<section name="Step 2: Configuration.">
<p>After installing the binary, the next step is to adjust the initial configuration.  The server should be stopped, and then 
configuration can proceed.  The most essential configuration is set in the config.xml file.  This file can be 
found in the apps/james/SAR-INF subdirectory of the installation directory.</p>
<p>The out of the box configuration makes certain assumptions and has some default values that are unlikely to 
be appropriate for real-world servers.  There are a few issues that should be addressed immediately upon installation:</p>
<ul>
<li>RemoteManager Administrator Account - Before the RemoteManager service can be used to add users to this server 
installation an administrator account must be created.  More information can be found <a href="remotemanager_configuration.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>DNS Servers - James needs to have access to a DNS server for domain resolution.  The out of the box 
configuration assumes that there is a DNS server on localhost.  In general administrators will have to change 
the configuration to point to a valid DNS server.  This can be done by adjusting the dnsserver configuration 
block in the config.xml.  More information can be found <a href="serverwide_configuration.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>Managed Domain Names/IP Addresses - Out of the box, James only handles mail that is sent to recipients at 
localhost.  It will attempt to deliver all other email to remote SMTP servers.  To allow James to handle email 
for your domain or IP address, you simply need to add the appropriate domain name or IP address to the servernames 
section of the config.xml.  More information can be found <a href="serverwide_configuration.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>Postmaster Address - More information can be found <a href="serverwide_configuration.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to adjusting these parameters, you may wish to consult the documentation for a discussion of
common configurations.  A list of such configurations, as well as the steps necessary to configure them, can
be found <a href="index.html">here</a>.</p>
 <p>Read the short and snappy documentation at docs/index.html for a proper
    overview of configuring the system.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Summary</b> (for impatient people)
  </p>
  
<p> M$ users should just run /bin/run.bat. Unix users will find run.sh under the 
  same directory. A JVM must be present and its location specified in the JAVA_HOME 
  environment variable. Set this on windows at the command prompt with something 
  similar to &quot;set JAVA_HOME=\jdk1.3\bin&quot; on *nix with JAVA_HOME=/jdk1.3/</p>
<p> Running [run* --help] will provide a simple command line help. </p>
  <p>
    Most UNIX systems require superuser privileges to open sockets below 1024,
    which includes the IANA-standard SMTP (on port 25) and POP3 (on port 110).
    These default ports can be changed in the conf.xml file. (Obviously, you
    would then need to reconfigure your clients. This may not be an option if
    you want to receive mail from external mailservers.)
  </p>
  
<p> The Avalon framework will unpack the necessary configuration files you will 
  need to start the server.  Wait until it is running, stop it again (ctrl-c), and 
  edit the configuration (thereafter *nix users can run the server in the background 
  using ./run.sh &amp;). For basic use, you only need to set two items in the 
  JAMES.conf.xml file: a root password for the remote administration facility 
  and the IP address of a DNS server. Once you have edited the configuration files, 
  press 'Enter' on the terminal where Avalon is waiting. </p>
</section>

<section name="Step 4: Kickstart.">
<p>Once you have edited the configuration file you will need to restart James so that the changes take 
effect.  When James starts, a list of the James services and the ports on which they are listening should 
be displayed on the console.  Additional information about the system configuration is printed in the James log files 
upon startup.</p>
<p>Finally, after configuration is complete, it will be necessary to create user accounts before the James server 
will be fully operational.  Instructions on creating user accounts can be found 
<a href="adding_users.html">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Once started you'll see a message saying Avalon is running. This means that
    Avalon has loaded JAMES and every other needed Block (see /logs/avalon.log)
    and is now waiting for a socket request.
    Since at the beginning James is empty, it will not have any local users
    registered.
    To register a local user open a telnet session with localhost on port 4555,
    log in as root ("root[enter]  &lt;password-you-set-in-conf.xml&gt;[enter]") and
    type "help" for a list of available commands in the "JAMES remote
    administrator tool". It is really a basic set but should allow you to test
    installation.</p>
  <p>Once you have some local users registered, try sending mail to one of them
    @localhost with SMTP (port 25) (assuming you have not changed the default
    server names in the conf.xml file). You'll see the mail appear under
    ../var/mail/localinbox/[user].
    Try now to retrieve that mail using POP3 (port 110).
    Trace out JAMES actions in /logs/*info.log.
    Actions that will be taken by JAMES on incoming mail are configured in
    the mailet pipe line (/conf/JAMES.conf.xml). Look at it if you want to
    understand what's happening.</p>
