  <title>James 3.0 - Adding Users</title>
 </properties>

<body>

  <section name="Manage Users via Telnet">
  
    <p>User accounts are shared across services.  A common user repository is shared across James 
    services.  That is, once you've created a POP3 mail account and set a password, that same 
    account is available for authenticated SMTP and NNTP.</p>
    
    <p>Once James is up and listening, adding a user is simple:</p>
    
    <p><ol>

      <li>Telnet to the host and port on which the RemoteManager is listening.  For command-line telnet clients 
      this is generally done by typing "telnet &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;" where &lt;host&gt; is the James 
      hostname and &lt;port&gt; is the RemoteManager port specified in the James config.xml.</li>
  
      <li>You will be prompted for your administrator userid and password.  Enter the values you specified 
      in the James remotemanager.xml.</li>
      
      <li>After logging in, type "adduser &lt;user&gt; &lt;password&gt;" where &lt;user&gt; is the user name 
      and &lt;password&gt; is the password of the account you wish to create.  Please note that the user name 
      MUST be a complete email address of the form &lt;user&gt;@&lt;domain&gt; 
      (where &lt;domain&gt; is any of the values specified in the &lt;servernames&gt; block of XMLDomainList or
      a domain defined via the <a href="manage-domains.html">domain management</a>).</li>
      
      <li>Repeat step 3 for all user accounts you wish to create.</li>
    
    </ol></p>
    
    <p>That's it.  Your users are now created and can be used by all James services.</p>
    
  </section>

  <section name="Manage Users via JMX">
  
    <p>Use and JMX client to access the Users management function.</p>
  
    <p>The managed objects are exposed from localhost only (for security reasons) on the following URL:</p>
      
    <p><code>service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:9999/jmxrmi</code></p>
     
    <p>If you want a remote access, you can install a web application management tool such as jmanage. 
       You will get screens such as the following one.</p>
