  <title>James 3.0 - Manage Virtual Users</title>
 </properties>

<body>

  <section name="Introduction to Virtual Users">

    <p>The only way to manage the virtual users is called "mapping" 
       (the previous "alias" and "forwarding" functions are 
       deprecated and you should not use them anymore.</p>
  
<source>
addmapping [toUser@toDomain] [fromMapping] add mapping for the given email addres
listallmappings list all mappings
listmapping [user@domain] list all mappings for the given emailaddress
removemapping [toUser@toDomain] [fromMapping] remove mapping for the given emailaddress
</source>

    <p>You will add mapping from an existing user to a virtual user. So read "addmapping toVirtual fromExisting".</p>

    <p>You can also use wildcards (*) and regular expressions in the fromExisting.</p>

  </section>

  <section name="Manage Virtual Users via Telnet">
  
    <p>Once James is up and listening, adding a user is simple:</p>
    
    <p><ol>

      <li>Telnet to the host and port on which the RemoteManager is listening.  For command-line telnet clients 
      this is generally done by typing "telnet &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;" where &lt;host&gt; is the James 
      hostname and &lt;port&gt; is the RemoteManager port specified in the James config.xml.</li>
  
      <li>You will be prompted for your administrator userid and password.  Enter the values you specified 
      in the James remotemanager.xml.</li>
      
      <li>After logging in, type "addmapping &lt;to&gt; &lt;from&gt;" where &lt;to&gt; is the new user name 
         and &lt;from&gt; is the existing username you wish to map.  Please note that the user name 
         MUST be a complete email address.</li>
      
      <li>Repeat step 3 for all mapping you wish to create.</li>
    
    </ol></p>
    
    <p>That's it.  Your mappings are now created and can be used by all James services.</p>
    
  </section>

  <section name="Manage Virtual Users via JMX">
  
    <p>Use and JMX client to access the Virtual User management function.</p>
  
    <p>The managed objects are exposed from localhost only (for security reasons) on the following URL:</p>
      
    <p><code>service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:9999/jmxrmi</code></p>
