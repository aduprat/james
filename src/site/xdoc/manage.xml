  <section name="Manage James Server">
  
    <p>You need to make sure that your user/domain/mail repository configuration is correct before managing.  If 
    you change your user/domain/mail repository type (i.e. file to database) or the configuration of your user repository 
    (i.e. the file or database URL) after you have added user/domain/mail, you may lose your user/domain/mail data.  Please change these 
    values with care.</p>
  
    <p>After you've done this, restart James to ensure that any changes you've made in 
       the configuration are incorporated into the running system.</p>
       
     <p>You are now ready to manage <a href="manage-domains.html">domains</a>, 
       <a href="manage-users.html">users</a> and <a href="manage-virtualusers.html">virtual users</a>.</p>

    <p>You can manage James via:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><a href="Manage_via_Telnet">Telnet (Remote Manager)</a></li>
      <li><a href="Manage_via_JMX">JMX</a></li>
    </ol>
    
    <subsection name="Manage via Telnet">
  
      <p>Once James is up and listening, manage via telnet is simple:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Telnet to the host and port on which the RemoteManager is listening.  For command-line telnet clients 
            this is generally done by typing "telnet &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;" where &lt;host&gt; is the James 
            hostname and &lt;port&gt; is the RemoteManager port specified in the James remotemanager.xml config file.</li>
        <li>You will be prompted for your administrator userid and password.  Enter the values you specified 
            in the James remotemanager.xml.</li>
        <li>type help to get a list of available commands.</li>
      </ul>
  
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection name="Manage via JMX">
    
      <p>James can be managed via JMX.</p>
      
      <p>The managed objects are exposed from localhost only (for security reasons) on the following URL:</p>
      
      <p><code>service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:9999/jmxrmi</code></p>
      
      <p>Simply launch jconsole to access the exposed attributes and methods.</p>

          <strong>JMX on Windows:</strong>
          to let windows start with jmx username/password enabled, 
          you need to modify the security settings for the jmx files like descripted here:

      <p>If you want a remote access, you can install a web application management tool such as jmanage. 
         You will get screens such as the following one.</p>
