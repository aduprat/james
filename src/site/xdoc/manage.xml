  <section name="Manage James Server">
  
    <p>You can manage James via:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>JMX</li>
      <li>Remote Manager</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>You need to make sure that your user/domain/mail repository configuration is correct before managing.  If 
    you change your user/domain/mail repository type (i.e. file to database) or the configuration of your user repository 
    (i.e. the file or database URL) after you have added user/domain/mail, you may lose your user/domain/mail data.  Please change these 
    values with care.</p>
  
    <p>After you've done this, restart James to ensure that any changes you've made in the configuration are incorporated into 
    the running system.  You are now ready to create users/domains.</p>

    <subsection name="Manage via JMX">
    
      <p>James can be managed via JMX. Simply launch jconsole to access 
        the exposed attributes and methods.</p>
  
      <div class="ui-widget">
        <div class="ui-state-error ui-corner-all" style="padding: 0 .7em;"> 
          <p><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-alert" style="float: left; margin-right: .3em;"></span> 
          <strong>JMX on Windows:</strong>
          to let windows start with jmx username/password enabled, 
          you need to modify the security settings for the jmx files like descripted here:

    <subsection name="Manage via Telnet">
  
      <p>Once James is up and listening, manage via telnet is simple:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Telnet to the host and port on which the RemoteManager is listening.  For command-line telnet clients 
            this is generally done by typing "telnet &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;" where &lt;host&gt; is the James 
            hostname and &lt;port&gt; is the RemoteManager port specified in the James config.xml.</li>
        <li>You will be prompted for your administrator userid and password.  Enter the values you specified 
            in the James remotemanager.xml.</li>
      </ul>
