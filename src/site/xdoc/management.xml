    <p>Once James is up and listening, adding a user is simple:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Telnet to the host and port on which the RemoteManager is listening.  For command-line telnet clients 
      this is generally done by typing "telnet &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;" where &lt;host&gt; is the James 
      hostname and &lt;port&gt; is the RemoteManager port specified in the James config.xml.</li>
      <li>You will be prompted for your administrator userid and password.  Enter the values you specified 
      in the James config.xml.</li>
    </ul>
