  <section name="Manage Domains">
  
    <p>Domain accounts are shared across services.  A common Domain repository is shared across James 
    services.  That is, once you've created a POP3 mail and set a password, that same 
    is available for authenticated SMTP and NNTP.</p>
    
    <p>Once James is up and listening, adding a Domain is simple:</p>

    <p>1. Telnet to the host and port on which the RemoteManager is listening.  For command-line telnet clients 
    this is generally done by typing "telnet &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;" where &lt;host&gt; is the James 
    hostname and &lt;port&gt; is the RemoteManager port specified in the James config.xml.</p>

    <p>2. You will be prompted for your administrator Domainid and password.  Enter the values you specified 
    in the James config.xml.</p>
    
    <p>3. After logging in, type "addDomain &lt;Domain&gt; &lt;password&gt;" where &lt;Domain&gt; is the Domain name 
    and &lt;password&gt; is the password of the you wish to create.  Please note that the Domain name 
    should NOT be a complete email address.  Rather, all email addresses of the form &lt;Domain&gt;@&lt;domain&gt; 
    (where &lt;domain&gt; is any of the values specified in the &lt;servernames&gt; block) will be delivered to 
    this by default.  Mailet configuration can change this default behavior.</p>
    
    <p>4. Repeat step 3 for all Domain you wish to create.</p>
    
    <p>That's it.  Your Domain are now created and can be used by all James services.</p>
