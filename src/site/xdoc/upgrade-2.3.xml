  <section name="Migrate from Server 2.3 to Server 3.0">
  
    <subsection name="Migrate Configuration">

      <p>You need to carefully review each <a href="config.html">configuration file</a>
         and set the needed parameters according to your need. You will find back more or less
         the same technical information, but you will need to set them in different files.</p>
         
      <p>The fundamental difference is about the <a href="feature-persistence.html">mails persistence</a>.
         James 3.0 uses a different storage for user mails that for spam,... mails.</p>
       
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Migrate Users and Mails">

     <ul>
       <li>Set in james23.xml configuration file the type of user repository you were
           using in James 2.3 (example: org.apache.james.user.file.UsersFileRepository).
           You also need to set the URL you was using in 2.3 (db, file,..., example: URL="file://var/users/).
           If you were using file, you need to manually copy the user files to the folder you have specified (example: var/users).</li>
       <li>You can now go to JMX console and invoke the james23importer MBean.
           It needs two parameters : james23MailRepositoryPath (the mail repository you were using in James 2.3),
           and the defaultPassword(the default password that will be used to create the users).</li>
     </ul>
