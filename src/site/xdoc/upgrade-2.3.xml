  <section name="Upgrading Comments">
    <p>James upgrading involves a number of steps, each of which is described in some detail in the 
    following sections.  But as this sequence of steps has confused some users in the past, additional 
    comments seem warranted.</p>
    <p>It is important to realize that the James configuration files are not unpacked from the James 
    distribution until the first time James is started.  This is a consequence of the design of the 
    Avalon Phoenix container used to run James.  Once James has been started, the distribution will 
    be unpacked.  The server should be stopped, the configuration files edited, and the server restarted.</p>
    <p>So the Upgrading sequence is: <b>1) Start, 2) Stop, 3) Move 4) Edit, 5) Restart</b>.</p>
