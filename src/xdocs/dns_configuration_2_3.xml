  <title>James 2.3 - Configuring DNS Services</title>
 </properties>

<body>
<section name="DNS Configuration">

  
<p>DNS Transport services are controlled by a configuration block in
the config.xml. This block affects SMTP remote delivery.</p>

<p>The dnsserver tag defines the boundaries of the configuration
block. It encloses all the relevant configuration for the DNS server.
The behavior of the DNS service is controlled by the attributes and
children of this tag.</p> 

<p>The standard children of the dnsserver tag are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>servers</strong> - This is a list of DNS Servers to be used by James and are 
specified by one, or more <strong><i>server</i></strong> elements, which are child elements. 
Each server element is the IP address of a single DNS server.
<source>
&lt;servers&gt;
  &lt;server&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/server&gt;
  &lt;server&gt;166.181.194.205&lt;/server&gt;
&lt;/servers&gt;
</source>
</li>

<li><strong>authoritative</strong> - (<strong>true/false</strong>)This tag specifies whether or not 
to require authoritative (non-cached) DNS records; to only accept DNS responses that are 
authoritative for the domain. It is primarily useful in an intranet/extranet environment.
<p>This should always be <strong>false</strong> unless you understand the implications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
