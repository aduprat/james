Future improvements and fixes:

0) Try to unify the servlet behavior with HTTPServlets to allow servlet engine 
abstraction based on generic servlets.

1) Try a more elegant way of using MailHeaders to retrieve more specific information
from the mail avoiding to get it, change it and set it.

2) Extended input/output streams to ease the job of copying one stream to the other,
MIME encoding/decoding, etc...

3) Mail Servlet Sessions:  like HTTP servlets, mail servlets may gain power from the
ability to track user sessions. For example, mailing list information could be stored in
a session object managed by the servlet engine eliminating the need for simple database
operations.

4) Implementation of at least some of the mail servlet examples.
