This is Phoenix 4.2 trunk with updated libraries.

https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/avalon/cvs-migration-snapshot/avalon-phoenix/

Here are the differences between the svn version and this one:

- removed xml libraries (we run only in java 1.4+)
- upgraded avalon libraries to 4.3
- upgraded cornerstone libraries to 2.1
- upgraded logkit to 2.1
- changed the default SystemManager to NoopSystemManager in kernel.xml

- upgraded wrapper.* files to 3.2.0 release (http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/)

- add new jar for invoke phoenix via commonns daemon.

- added this code to org.apache.avalon.phoenix.launcher.Main:121:
  ---------------------------------
    // Set the Security property to the same value of the system property.
    String ttlcache = System.getProperty("networkaddress.cache.ttl");
    if (ttlcache != null) {
        Security.setProperty("networkaddress.cache.ttl" , ttlcache);
    }
  ---------------------------------

- added a "-Dnetworkaddress.cache.ttl=300" to all executing scripts:
  wrapper.conf, phoenix.sh, run.bat, james-server.sh

Changed the build.xml to reflect the changes.

Rebuilt.
