# Needed steps to migrate from phoenix based deployment to the new spring one

1. Copy your old config.xml file to conf/james-config.xml

	% cp /path/to/james-old/apps/james/SAR-INF/config.xml /path/to/james/conf/config.xml


2. Copy over your old data from /path/to/james-old/apps/james/var/ to /path/to/james/var .

	% cp -r /path/to/james-old/apps/james/var/* /path/to/james/var/
	
	
3. Adjust paths in james-config.xml. Replace ../apps/james/var/* with ../var/*

	
4. If you made any adjustments in the assembly.xml you need todo the same adjustment in the spring-beans.xml file. 
   For more details how the spring beans get configured please see the spring documentation


5. If you made any adjustments in the enviroment.xml for logging you need to configure the same in log4j.properties. 
   For more details how log4j.properties are configured please see the log4j documentation.
