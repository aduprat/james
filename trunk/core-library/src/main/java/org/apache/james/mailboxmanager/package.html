    <p> This is now some kind of complete as it reflects the ideas I have in mind. Of
    course it's still far away from being finished. There maybe cleaner ways than MessageResult
    and GeneralMessageSet... It would be much easier to just write an API for a JDBC based
    IMAP backend. I hope for discussion and help to make this fit into James.</p>
    <p> Main topic of discussion should be MailboxRepository and the interfaces which
      ImapMailbox extends.
      <br/> Quota and Acl/Rights will stay drafts until the time has come. </p>
    <p>The level of integration into James code base is an important question. It should be
      possible to introduce this without having to touch existing James code.
      NamespaceMailRepository will lookup and wrap a Mailbox. In a long term view more
      integration should be done like using namespaces in whole james, because it makes no
      sense to deal with two different approaches which blows up code base.</p>
