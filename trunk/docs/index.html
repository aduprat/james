<h3 align="center">a.k.a. Apache James </h3>

<h3>What is it?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server (a.k.a. Apache James) will be a 100% pure Java
  server application designed to be a complete and portable enterprise mail engine solution
  based on currently available open protocols (SMTP, POP3, IMAP).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Development Status</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apache James is currently under development. There is no working distribution or
  anything usable, yet. So, don't ask. <strong>Since this server will be based on the Java
  Apache Server Framework, it's development is stopped until the framework is done.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Planned Features</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are some of the planned features:<ul>
    <li>complete portability: Apache James will be a 100% pure Java applicationbased on the Java
      2 platform and on to of JavaMail extentions.</li>
    <li>based on the Java Apache Server Framework: Apache James will be buit using the design
      guidelines and the engineering rules defined by the server framework. See the <a
      href="../framework/index.html">framework pages</a> for more info on what this means.</li>
    <li>protocol abstraction: unlike other mail engines, protocols are seen only like
      &quot;communication languages&quot; ruling comunications between clients and the server.
      Apache James will not be tied to any particular protocol but will follow an abstracted
      server design (almost like JavaMail did on the client side)</li>
    <li>complete solution: the mail system will be able to handle both mail transport and
      storage in a single server application. Apache James will work alone without the need of
      any other server or solution.</li>
    <li>servlet support: Apache James will be the first mail server with MailServlet support.
      Apache James will allow users and developers to write powerful mail system enhancements
      using the designed MailServlet framework.</li>
    <li>secure and multi-threaded design: based on the technology developed for the Apache JServ
      servlet engine, Apache James will have a careful, security-oriented, full multi-threaded
      design, to allow performance, scalability and mission-critical use.</li>
    <li>anything else you may want if you help us writing it :-)</li>
  </ul>
