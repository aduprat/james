<h1 align="center">Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server</h1>

<h3 align="center">a.k.a. Apache JAMES </h3><br>

<h4 align="center">JAMES documentation is under construction.<br>
        Everything you can find outside this page <br> is to be considered obsolete.  </h4>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Download distibution. You will find the last update in the java.apache.org download page.
  Extract all files in your favorite folder.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Startup Configuration</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>In the distribution you'll find configuration file "/conf/avalon.conf.xml".
    Edit /conf/avalon.conf.xml and fill it with needed configuration follwing
    instructions inside. The configuration file is filled with defaults. Values 
    which cannot be set as default needs to be filled. Basically to make it work 
    just replace any FILL ME tag with the appropiate value.</p> 
</blockquote>    

<h3>Run</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>M$ users shuold just run /bin/run.bat. Unix users will find run.sh
    under the same folder (which is not tested). A JVM must be in the path.
    Running [run* -help] will provide a simple command line help.</p>
    By default Avalon will use Xerces.jar as XML parser, place the log file 
    in /logs/ and uses as configuration file /conf/avalon.conf.xml. 
    You can override these defaults using run [options].
</blockquote>    

<h3>Kickstart</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>Once started you'll see a message saying Avalon is running. This means Avalon 
    has loaded JAMES and every other needed Block (see /logs/avalon.log) and is 
    now waiting for a socket request.
     
    Since at beginning James is empty, it will not have any local user registered.
    To add a local inbox open a telnet session with localhost on port 4555, log in
    as root ("root[enter] root[enter]" see in config) and type "help" for a list of availale
    command in the "JAMES remote administrator tool". It is really a basic set but 
    should allow you to test installation. An improved managing tool will be available as
    soon as someone help writing it :).
    
    Once you have some local users registered try sending mail to one of them @localhost
    with SMTP (port 25). You'll see the mail appear under /mail/localinbox/[user].
    Try now to retrive that mail using POP3 (port 110).
    Trace out JAMES actions in /logs/*info.log.
    Action that will be taken by JAMES on incoming mail are configurated in the servlet
    pipe line (/conf/avalon.conf.xml). Look at it if you want to understand what's appening.</p>

<p>  Good luck :)</p>
