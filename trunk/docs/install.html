<h4 align="center">JAMES documentation is under construction.<br>
        Everything you can find outside this page <br> is to be considered obsolete.  </h4>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Download distibution. You will find the last update in the java.apache.org download page.
  Extract all files in your favorite folder.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Startup</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>M$ users shuold just run /bin/run.bat. Unix users will find run.sh
    under the same folder. A JVM must be in the path.
    The Loader will extract the configuration template from the jar (James.jar)
    and place it under /conf/. Then will prompt you to fill the template with 
    needed values. 
    Edit /conf/james.conf.xml and fill it with needed configuration follwing
<<<<<<< install.html
    instructions inside. The configuration file is filled with defaults. Values 
    which cannot be set as default needs to be filled. Basically to make it work 
    just replace any FILL ME tag with the appropiate value.
    Current distribution just need that you set your DNS server in the RemoteDelivery 
    mailet configuration. All other .conf files belongs to others Blocks that 
    cohoperate with JAMES to make it work. They do not need specific configurations
    since they are filled with defaults but a fast look may help.</p> 

    <p>Running [run* -help] will provide a simple command line help.
    By default Avalon will use Xerces.jar as XML parser, place the log file 
    in /logs/ and uses as configuration file /conf/avalon.conf.xml. 
    You can override these defaults using run [options].</p>

<h3>Run</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>M$ users shuold just run /bin/run.bat. Unix users will find run.sh
    under the same folder (which is not tested). A JVM must be in the path.
    Running [run* -help] will provide a simple command line help.</p>
    By default Avalon will use Xerces.jar as XML parser, place the log file
    in /logs/ and uses as configuration file /conf/avalon.conf.xml.
    You can override these defaults using run [options].
</blockquote>
>>>>>>> 1.4

<h3>Kickstart</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>Once started you'll see a message saying Avalon is running. This means Avalon
    has loaded JAMES and every other needed Block (see /logs/avalon.log) and is
    now waiting for a socket request.

    At first run James will not have any local user set so it will only relay mail to remote servers.
    To add a local inbox open a telnet session with localhost on port 4555, log in
    as root ("root[enter] root[enter]" see in config) and type "help" for a list of availale
    command in the "JAMES remote administrator tool". It is really a basic set but
    should allow you to test installation. An improved managing tool will be available as
    soon as someone help writing it :).

    Once you have some local users registered try sending mail to one of them @localhost
    with SMTP (port 25). You'll see the mail appear under /mail/localinbox/[user].
    Try now to retrive that mail using POP3 (port 110).
    Trace out JAMES actions in /logs/*info.log.
    Action that will be taken by JAMES on incoming mail are configurated in the mailet
    pipe line (/conf/james.conf.xml). Look there if you want to understand what's appening.</p>

<p>  Good luck :)</p>
