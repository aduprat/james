This is a custom branch of Phoenix 4.0.4.

Here are the differences between official phoenix 4.0.4 and the one James uses:

- removed libs
	- avalon-framework-4.1.3.jar
	- excalibur-collections-1.0.jar
	- excalibur-concurrent-1.0.jar
	- excalibur-instrument-1.0.jar
	- excalibur-pool-1.0.jar
	- excalibur-thread-1.1.jar
	- logkit-1.1.1.jar
- added libs
	- avalon-framework-api-4.3-RC2.jar
	- avalon-framework-impl-4.3-RC2.jar
	- avalon-logkit-2.1-RC2.jar

We also can remove xerces/xalan/xml-apis as we don't need jdk1.3 compatibility anymore.

Changed the build.xml to reflect the changes.

Rebuilt.
