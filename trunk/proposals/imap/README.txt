OVERVIEW

This is the alpha IMAP server implementation that was in the main branch.  I've (SK) moved it
to the proposal directory, but am not 100% sure if it will run (since it was alpha quality,
I'm not sure what should be working).  Hopefully someone can come and make this run great! 
We miss you Charles!
