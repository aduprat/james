    <!-- STOP - before you uncomment out the DNS RBL handler,
         please take a moment to review each block list.  We
         have included some that various JAMES committers use,
         but you must decide which, if any, are appropriate
         for your environment.  The mail servers hosting
         @apache.org mailing lists, for example, use a
         slightly different list than we have included below.
         And it is likely that most JAMES committes also have
         slightly different sets of lists.  The SpamAssassin
         user's list would be one good place to discuss the
         measured quality of various block lists.

         NOTA BENE: the domain names, below, are terminated
         with '.' to ensure that they are absolute names in
         DNS lookups.  Under some circumstances, names that
         are not explicitly absolute could be treated as
         relative names, leading to incorrect results.  This
         has been observed on *nix and MS-Windows platforms
         by users of multiple mail servers, and is not JAMES
         specific.  If you are unsure what this means for you,
         please speak with your local system/network admins.
