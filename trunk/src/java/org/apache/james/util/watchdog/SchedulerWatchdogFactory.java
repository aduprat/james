 * This class is a factory to produce Watchdogs, each of which is associated

 *
 * This could be used in James by adding a server configuration
 * parameter:
 *
 *     schedulerWatchdogs = conf.getChild("useSchedulerWatchdogs").getValueAsBoolean(false);
 *
 * getting the TimeScheduler component:
 *
 *     scheduler = (TimeScheduler) compMgr.lookup(TimeScheduler.ROLE);
 *
 * and changing AbstractJamesService.getWatchdogFactory to look
 * something like:
 *
 *     protected WatchdogFactory getWatchdogFactory() {
 *        WatchdogFactory theWatchdogFactory = null;
 *        if (schedulerWatchdogs) {
 *             theWatchdogFactory = new SchedulerWatchdogFactory(scheduler, timeout);
 *           } else {
 *             theWatchdogFactory = new ThreadPerWatchdogFactory(threadPool, timeout);
 *           }
 *        if (theWatchdogFactory instanceof LogEnabled) {
 *             ((LogEnabled)theWatchdogFactory).enableLogging(getLogger());
 *        }
 *        return theWatchdogFactory;
