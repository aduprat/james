<section name="Version 1.2.1">
<p>Released 13 December 2000</p>
<ul>
<li>(SK,SR,CB) (update) Fix for "stuck file" problem in Avalon mail repository.</li>
<li>(SK) (design) Made usernames case insensitive on MailAddress</li>
<li>(SK) (code) Complete rewrite of processor code to send through Mail object through matchers and mailets.  Design might be less efficient but easier to understand and more flexible for later improvements to API.  Also no longer "loses" IP address and error message information when Mail object go from one processor/state to the next (ToProcessor changed as well now that processor works).</li>
<li>(SK) (update) Updated to JavaMail 1.2</li>
<li>(SK) (update) Changed instantiation of recipients on a Mail object to a Set (HashSet) whenever possible in preparation for the API having this change.</li>
<li>(IS) (code) Added UsersTownRepository to let you maintain user lists in a database</li>
<li>(SR) (update) In POP3 handler, properly includes headers in calculating size of messages.</li>
<li>(SK) (update) Removed "synchronized" attribute on many methods in town and file spool repositories.  Should significantly boost performance and multithreaded capabilities.</li>
<li>(SK) (code) Optimization of town mail repository, introduction of JamesMimeMessageInputStream and the James MimeMessage.  Should significantly reduce the number of unnecessary parses or saves on MimeMessages in server.</li>
<li>(SR) (update) Properly calculates hashCode for MailAddress so duplicates do not exist in Hashmaps</li>
<li>(SR) (update) Hardcoded serialVerUID on MailAddress and MailImpl to that of James 1.2 release so future releases can continue to use mail stored in earlier releases.</li>
<li>(IS) (update) Added ability on NotifySender and NotifyPostmaster to attach informative notice.</li>
<li>(SK) (update) GenericListservManager now requires existsAddress() which it uses to prevent someone already on the list from subscribing or someone not on the list from removing themselves.</li>
<li>(SK) (update) Changed User repository for file to *always* end the destination with a File.separator.  Otherwise if people mixed usage of this, it would crash the repositories with confusing error messages.  Child repositories were already properly created with a terminating File.separator.</li>
<li>(SK) (code) New matcher: IsSingleRecipient</li>
<li>(SK) (code) Added spam blacklist checking for 3 spam blacklists that make this available in a simple DNS lookup check.  All free services through mail-abuse.org.  Added to default configuration in JAMES.conf.xml</li>
<li>(PU) (code) Added first testing program.  This would recreate file stuck problem.  Would be good to build collection of testing utilities in this new package.</li>
<li>(SK) (docs) Documented what all the jars are in the lib directory (what they're called, where they're from)</li>
</ul>

<section name="Version 1.2">
<p>Released 16 October 2000</p>
<ul>
<li>(SK) (design) Abstracted mailet API to be Avalon (implementation) independent</li>
<li>(CB) (code) Abstracted mail repository in JAMES/Avalon to allow more varied implementations.</li>
<li>(SK) (code) Database implementations of mail repositories</li>
<li>(SK) (code) Changed remote delivery to use an outgoing spool with a specified number of delivery threads</li>
<li>(CB) (code) Experimental implementation of LDAP user manager</li>
<li>(SK) (update) Reworked mailets and matchers to fit new API and added many more classes</li>
<li>(CB, SK) (update) Fixed some bugs in POP3 server</li>
<li>(CB) (update) Added full TLS support in POP3 (POP3S)</li>
<li>(SK) (update) Fixed sorting of MX records so it attempts delivery in correct order</li>
<li>(SK) (update) Changed remote manager to not allow a login if an admin account's password is empty,
    and sets the root account's password empty by default (so you have to set one... prevents someone
    from knowing the password to your system out of the box)</li>
