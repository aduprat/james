  <title>James 2.1 - Configuring FetchPOP</title>
 </properties>

<body>
<section name="FetchPOP Configuration">
<p>FetchPOP is controlled by a configuration block in the config.xml.
The fetchpop tag defines the boundaries of the configuration block.  It encloses 
all the relevant configuration for the FetchPOP scheduler.  The behavior of the POP service is
controlled by the attributes and children of this tag.</p>
<p>This tag has an optional boolean attribute - <strong>enabled</strong> - that defines whether 
the service is active or not.  The value defaults to "false" if not present.</p>
<p>The only permitted children of the fetchpop tag are <strong>fetch</strong>elements.  Each of 
these <strong>fetch</strong> tags defines a single FetchPOP task.</p>
<p>The <strong>fetch</strong> tag has a single required attribute, <strong>name</strong>.  The name 
of each FetchPOP task must be unique.</p>
<p>In addition to the <strong>name</strong> attribute, the <strong>fetch</strong> tag has four 
children, all of which are required.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>host</strong> - The host name or IP address of the POP3 server hosting the mail to be fetched.</li>
<li><strong>user</strong> - The user name of the account whose mail is to be fetched.</li>
<li><strong>password</strong> - The password for the account whose mail is to be fetched.</li>
<li><strong>interval</strong> - A non-negative integer representing the number of milliseconds between fetches.</li>
</ul>
