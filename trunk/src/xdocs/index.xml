<section name="What is it?">
<p>The Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server (a.k.a. Apache James) is a 100% pure <b>Java SMTP and POP3 Mail server and NNTP News server</b>.  We designed James to be a complete and portable enterprise mail engine solution based on currently available open protocols. </p>
<p>James is also a <i>mail application platform</i>.  We have developed a Java API to let you write Java code to process emails that we call the mailet API.  A <b>mailet</b> can generate an automatic reply, update a database, prevent spam, build a message archive, or whatever you can imagine.  A <b>matcher</b> determines whether your mailet should process an email in the server.  The James project hosts the Mailet API, and James provides an implementation of this mail application platform API.</p>
<p>James is based upon the Apache Avalon application framework. (For more information about Avalon, please go to <a href="http://avalon.apache.org/">http://avalon.apache.org/</a>)</p>
<p>James requires Java 2 (either JRE 1.3 or 1.4 as of 2.0a3).</p>
