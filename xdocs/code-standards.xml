<s1 title="Coding Standards">

<p>
    Submissions to the James project must follow the coding conventions 
    outlined in this document. James developers 
    are asked to follow coding conventions already present in the code. 
    (For example, if the existing code has the bracket on
    the same line as the if statement, then all subsequent code
    should also follow that convention.) Anything not 
    explicitly mentioned in this document should adhere to the 
    official
    <link href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html">Sun
    Java Coding Conventions</link>. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Developers who commit code that does not follow 
    the coding conventions outlined in this document will be 
    responsible for fixing their own code.</strong>
</p>

<p>
1. Brackets should begin and end on new lines. Examples:
</p>

<p>
<source><![CDATA[

if ( foo )
{
    // code here
}    

try
{
    // code here
}
catch (Exception bar)
{
    // code here
}
finally
{
    // code here
}    

while ( true )
{
    // code here
}    
]]></source>
</p>

<p>
2. Spaces between parentheses are optional. The preference is to exclude 
extra spaces. Both of these conventions are acceptable:
</p>

<p>
<source><![CDATA[

if (foo)

or

if ( foo )
]]></source>
</p>

<p>
3. Four spaces. <strong>NO</strong> tabs. Period. The James
mailing list receives cvs commit messages that are almost impossible 
to read if tabs are used.
</p>

<p>
In Emacs-speak, this translates to the following command:

(setq-default tab-width 4 indent-tabs-mode nil)
</p>

<p>
4. Use Unix linefeeds for all .java source code files. Only platform-specific
files (e.g. .bat files for Windows) should contain non-Unix linefeeds.
</p>

<p>
5. Javadoc <strong>MUST</strong> exist on all methods. Contributing
a missing javadoc for any method, class, variable, etc., will be greatly
appreciated as this will help to improve the James project.
</p>

<p>
6. The Jakarta Apache/James License <strong>MUST</strong> be placed 
at the top of every file.
</p>
